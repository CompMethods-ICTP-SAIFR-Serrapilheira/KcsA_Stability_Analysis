	abstract = {Ion channels represent some of the most ancient mechanisms for cells to sense and respond to their external environment. The physiological importance of these proteins is suggested by their evolutionary stability and through numerous naturally occurring disease states derived from channel dysfunction. The primary role of ion channels is to regulate the passage of ions across the cell membrane, and the alteration of intracellular ion concentration can be seen as the primary signaling mechanism of ion channels. Ion channels display characteristic ion selectivity that is provided by the very structure and juxtaposition of the ion channel subunits within the cell membrane. However, recent observations have found that some ion channels demonstrate altered ion selectivity that is time- and conformationally dependent. Additionally, some classes of ion channels have been shown to activate signaling enzymes more often considered as part of the signal transduction pathways of other receptors. Thus, these observations suggest that ion channels have the capability to display functional selectivity (biased signaling) recently attributed to nuclear receptors or G protein-coupled receptors. Moreover, some channels have been found to have altered ion selectivity or activation of associated signaling enzymes in a ligand-dependent fashion. These revelations not only provide a new perspective on the function of ion channels but also expand the potential roles of ion channels in modulating cell activity. Perhaps more importantly, biased signaling in ion channels may provide another opportunity to more efficiently exploit this class of receptor for therapeutic benefit.},

	abstract = {The tetrameric potassium channel from Streptomyces lividans (KcsA) embedded in planar bilayers exhibits the following electrophysiological characteristics: (i) K+ ions can cross the pore in a highly hydrated state (n H2O≳6), (ii) the selectivity for K+ exceeds that for Na+ ions by 11 times, and both Ca2+ and Mg2+ are permeant, (iii) the internal side is blocked by Ba2+ ions in a voltage-dependent manner, (iv) intrinsic rectification is due to gating, depending on the direction of the electric field, (v) the internal side is pH-sensitive, and (vi) the open pore has a diameter of ∼5.8 Å. In conclusion, our results show that ion conduction and selectivity of KcsA cannot easily be reconciled with the properties deduced from the rigid crystal structure [Doyle et al., Science 280 (1998) 69–77], which must be concluded to have the pore trapped in its closed state.},

These channels are most remarkable in their ability to discriminate K+ from Na+ by more than a thousandfold and conduct at a throughput rate near diffusion limit. The recent progress in the structural characterization of K+ channel provides us with a unique opportunity to understand their function at the atomic level. With their ability to go beyond static structures, molecular dynamics simulations based on atomic models can play an important role in shaping our view of how ion channels carry out their function. The purpose of this review is to summarize the most important findings from experiments and computations and to highlight a number of fundamental mechanistic questions about ion conduction and selectivity that will require further work.},
